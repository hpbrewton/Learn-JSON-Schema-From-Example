<p>In <em>The Price for Their Pound of Flesh</em>, Berry discusses the concept of soul value. A soul value is the spiritual value of one’s immortal soul (p. 62). There seems to be a dark side of soul value. In the photographs on p. 177 and p. 180, and throughout Chapter 6, we see macabre scenes: groups of medical students photographed around the exummed bodies of cadavares with skulls across their scrubs. We also hear tell of the trade in body parts of executed slave rebels. We can ask a few questions about the soul value, given its worth to both the enslaved and the enslaver: is it a rivalrous good, is it a non-durable good, is it a merit good?</p>
